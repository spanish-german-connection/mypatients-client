# Mypatients App

This project was created as part of the Web Development Bootcamp from Ironhack, to practice all the concepts learn during the module 3 of the Bootcamp implementing an application based on the MERN Stack (MongoDB Express React Node).

The application was planned as a website for therapists to have a blog site with articles and events, and also a common place to manage its patients and the appointments with them.

## How to run this application

In order to run this application you need to add this environment variable to the platform where the site will be running:

```
- REACT_APP_API_URL: With the domain of the api
```
